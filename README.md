# Games-Engines-1-Assignment
### Description 
My goal is to build an environmental simulator, about grass, trees and stones. I will create a wind to simulate the movement of 
grass and trees in the wind. This should be a very interesting thing to do. If possible, I will add rain effects, or day and night 
ffects to the simulator to achieve different visual effects. It may be difficult but I will search some information myself to achieve 
it.
